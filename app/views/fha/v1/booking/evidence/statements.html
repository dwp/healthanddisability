      </p>
      <h3 class="heading-small mt5 mb0">What Tomas wrote in the box</h3>
      <p class="mt0 quote">“I had an accident in July - I was run over and it damaged my left leg. On a good day I can walk 100m slowly with crutches on the flat - I'd have to rest a couple of times though, as I'd be in pain. On a bad day, I can just about get around my flat but would usually stay in bed so I don't have to move much.”</p>
      
<h3 class="heading-medium mt0">Going up or down 2 steps</h3>
<h3 class="heading-small mt5 mb0">Tick box question</h3>
<p>Tomas says they <span class="bold-small">cannot</span> go up or down 2 steps without help from another person even if there is a rail to hold on to. </p>
<h3 class="heading-small mt5 mb0">What Tomas wrote in the box</h3>

      <p class="mt0 quote mb20"> “I’d find it hard to get up or down 2 steps on my own. My leg is damaged and I’m in constant pain, I can’t put any weight on it. I can use crutches. ” </p>

<h3 class="heading-small mt5 mb0">Tick box questions</h3>

 <p> Tomas says they <span class="bold-small">can</span> move from one seat to another right next to it without help from someone else.  
      </p>

<p> Tomas says they stay in one place pain free without help for <span class="bold-small">less than 30 minutes</span>.  
      </p>

<h3 class="heading-small mt5 mb0">What Tomas wrote in the box</h3>

      <p class="mt0 mb0 quote">"I can stand with crutches, but not without them. On a good day I might be able to stand for about 10 minutes but on a bad day it’s hard for me to use crutches at all, so I couldn’t really stand because I can’t put weight on my leg."</p>
      <p class="mt0 quote">"I can sit down but I have to elevate my leg and move it every so often. It gets uncomfortable because of the pain so I end up having to reposition myself."</p>
