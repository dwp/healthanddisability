I’ve found it hard to cope recently. My middle daughter has gone off the rails as I'm finding it hard to deal with her. Social services have got involved because she’s getting into trouble. With all this happening I’m not coping. My eldest daughter is having to do things that I should be doing for the kids, and I feel guilty all the time."</p>
