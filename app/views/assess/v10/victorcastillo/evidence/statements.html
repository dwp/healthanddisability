      <h3 class="heading-medium mt0">Moving around and using steps</h3>
      <p>Tomas says he can: move safely and repeatedly on level ground without needing to stop for: <span class="bold-small">100 metres</span>
      </p>
      <h3 class="heading-small mt5 mb0">Moving around and using steps</h3>
      <p class="mt0 quote">“I had an accident in July - I was run over and it damaged my left leg. On a good day I can walk 100m slowly with crutches on the flat - I'd have to rest a couple of times though, as I'd be in pain. On a bad day, I can just about get around my flat but would usually stay in bed so I don't have to move much.”</p>
      <h3 class="heading-small mt0 mb0">Going up or down 2 steps</h3>
      <p class="mt0 quote mb20"> “I’d find it hard to get up or down 2 steps on my own. My leg is damaged and I’m in constant pain, I can’t put any weight on it. I can use crutches. ” </p>

      <h3 class="heading-medium mt10">Standing and sitting</h3>
      <p class="mt0 mb0 quote">"I can stand with crutches, but not without them. On a good day I might be able to stand for about 10 minutes but on a bad day it’s hard for me to use crutches at all, so I couldn’t really stand because I can’t put weight on my leg."</p>
      <p class="mt0 quote">"I can sit down but I have to elevate my leg and move it every so often. It gets uncomfortable because of the pain so I end up having to reposition myself."</p>

    <h3 class="heading-medium mt10">Coping with changes to your daily routine</h3>
      <p class="mt0 mb0 quote">"I’ve had anxiety and depression for a while now, I’ve probably been on antidepressants for about 5 months. It got much worse since the accident. I’ve found it hard to cope recently. My middle daughter has gone off the rails as I'm finding it hard to deal with her. Social services have got involved because she’s getting into trouble. With all this happening I’m not coping. My eldest daughter is having to do things that I should be doing for the kids, and I feel guilty all the time."</p>

    <h3 class="heading-medium mt10">Meeting and being with people</h3>
      <p class="mt0 mb0 quote">"I’m finding it hard to deal with people. I have to go out and get things sometimes I don’t speak to anyone while I’m out. I know other parents and the neighbours think I’m rude but I just can’t."</p>
