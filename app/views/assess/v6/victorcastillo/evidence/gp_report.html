  <p>“I don’t know how far Tomas can walk. He uses crutches, but has problems with them because his wrists were broken in the accident. I imagine it’s not very far. He gets a taxi to the surgery and has help to get in. He tried a wheelchair but found this is harder on his wrists than the crutches.”</p>

  <p>"Tomas won’t be able to stand for long as he needs crutches to move and to balance, and his wrist injuries make this difficult. He sits for his appointments, usually about 10 minutes. I have prescribed an increasing dosage of opioids as Tomas is in a lot of pain."</p>
