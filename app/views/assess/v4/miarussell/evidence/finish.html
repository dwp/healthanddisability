      <h3 class="heading-small mt5 mb0">Moving around and using steps</h3>
      <p class="mt0 quote">“I had an accident in July - I was run over and it damaged my left leg. On a good day I can walk 100m slowly with crutches on the flat - I'd have to rest a couple of times though, as I'd be in pain. On a bad day, I can just about get around my flat but would usually stay in bed so I don't have to move much.”</p>
      <h3 class="heading-small mt0 mb0">Going up or down 2 steps</h3>
      <p class="mt0 quote mb20"> “I’d find it hard to get up or down 2 steps on my own. My leg is damaged and I’m in constant pain, I can’t put any weight on it. I can use crutches on a good day, but steps are difficult as my wrists were damaged in the accident and they’re not strong enough for me to be confident on crutches, especially not on the flat. ” </p>

      <h3 class="heading-large mt10">Standing and sitting</h3>
      <p class="mt0 mb0 quote">"I can stand with crutches, but not without them. How long I can stand up depends on how my wrists are feeling. On a good day I might be able to stand for about 10 minutes but on a bad day it’s hard for me to use crutches at all, so I couldn’t really stand because I can’t put weight on my leg."</p>
      <p class="mt0 quote">"I can sit down but I have to elevate my leg and move it every so often. It gets uncomfortable because of the pain so I end up having to reposition myself."</p>
