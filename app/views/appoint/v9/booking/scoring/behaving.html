  <h3 class="heading-large mt10">How your behaviour affects other people</h3>
  <p>Tony doesn't feel comfortable around people, except for his close family like me and his dad. He finds it hard to look people in the eye, or to look at them at all. It's not as bad when I'm with him because I can encourage him and say 'come on it's only so and so" but if he's on his own he ignores people. He'd never speak to a stranger. This causes problems because people think he's rude and it can get him into trouble. It upsets people. Some men started a fight with him because they said he looked at them funny and then completely ignored them. That's why he can't go out on his own that much. </p>
